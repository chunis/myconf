**myconf** is my dot files under **~/**. mainly about bash config and vim
config, with some small shell and python scripts. I put it here to make it
easier for me to setup them at other Linux machines.

The setup is very easy. Just change to the /path/to/myconf, then run:
**./setup.sh**. It will backup some ~/dot-files with current date as their
suffix, and create links to the files in myconf/dot_files. Then you just
run '**source ~/.bashrc**' to enable all the new configs.
